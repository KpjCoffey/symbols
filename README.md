# Symbololology

<https://tabatkins.github.io/symbols>

Easy access to commonly-needed symbols that aren't on your keyboard.

It's a one-pager,
and the list of symbols is in a JSON blob right at the top of the document,
so it's trivial to clone this project
and change the lists to whatever characters you prefer.

As such, I will not be taking any suggestions on the displayed characters;
the set currently displayed is purely what I personally find useful,
and can and will change over time.
